# Close App-launcher Tabs (Chrome Extension)

When a new tab opens, this extension compares that tab's URL to your custom list of URLs or URL parts. If there's a match, this extension will automatically close that tab after a small custom delay (default: 5 seconds).

Joining a lot of Zoom meetings from Google Calendar? Is Zoom leaving a lot of useless tabs open in Chrome? Linear? Other apps? Forget about it.

Ease your cognitive load. Keep your Chrome space clean.
